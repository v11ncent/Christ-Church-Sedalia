            We're a reformed baptist church in Sedalia, Missouri whose mission
            is to unashamedly preach, teach, and live the gospel of Jesus Christ
            to the glory of God. With deep roots in the reformed tradition, our
            church community passionately embraces our faith, boldly proclaiming
            the message of salvation through Christ. Our dedication to
            unashamedly preaching the gospel resonates throughout our worship
            services, where the Word of God is the central focus. Our dynamic
            and heartfelt sermons not only educate but also inspire our
            congregants to live out their faith with conviction.
