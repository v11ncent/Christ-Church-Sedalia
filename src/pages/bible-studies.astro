            We believe that teaching the gospel of Jesus Christ is of utmost
            importance. We embrace New City Catechism, which is a way to teach
            the gospel in easy to digest, bite-sized pieces. This is perfect for
            younger children, but is also effective for teens and adults if
            little of the gospel is known.

          <p>
            We teach children the gospel by studying New Chity Catechism.
            Catechisms allow children to easily understand truths of the gospel
            through bite-sized pieces. Each week builds upon the last which
            ultimately allows children to understand complex ideas about the
            gospel in a piecemeal way.

            We teach teenagers similarly to how we teach our children: in
            bite-sized pieces. However, we add a bit more complexity to our
            teachings each week. This allows teens to learn faster than our
            children without being too overwhelmed.

          <p>
            With our adult bible studies, we can go in one of two ways: normal
            bible-study (where the teachings are more complex), or piecemeal
            (like our other studies). If a particular group is already familiar
            with the teachings of Jesus Christ, we study the bible in a typical
            fashion. However, if a group of adults is unfamiliar with the
            gospel, we have found that it's easier to go the piecemeal approach.
